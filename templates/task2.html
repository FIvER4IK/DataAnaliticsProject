  <p>fluctuations index S&P
    on this graph, you can see the economic crises of the United States 
    (where the index is falling sharply), for example, after stable growth 
    since 2011, in 2020, you can see the crisis due to the coronavirus</p>
  <img src="/static/img/2-2.png">
  <p>you can see fluctuations in the price of oil occurring due to economic
       crises and the development of technology</p>
    <p>However, it is impossible to see something very interesting from individual graphs, so in the paragraph

    <p>2) The trends for the increase in gold and the SnP index will coincide</p>
